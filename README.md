# TCP/IP protocols applications

A series of university assigned projects:

## Router-Datapalane:
- This project involves implementing a router that uses the IP, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) protocols.
- It utilizes binary search to achieve O(log n) lookup of IP addresses, which is more efficient than the typical O(n) linear search.
- The router's primary function is to route packets between different networks, resolve MAC addresses using ARP, and handle ICMP messages.

## TCP/UDP Client-Server Subscribe Application:
- This application allows TCP clients to connect to a server and subscribe to various topics.
- UDP clients can send messages related to those topics via the server, which forwards them to the subscribed TCP clients.
- It involves implementing both the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocols.
- The server acts as an intermediary for communication between TCP and UDP clients.

## HTTP Client Books Store:
- This client application connects to a REST API that serves and processes books in JSON format.
- It can perform various HTTP requests, including GET, POST, and DELETE, to interact with the server.
- The application handles authentication, tracks cookies and tokens, and implements the HTTP protocol for making HTTP requests to the server.
